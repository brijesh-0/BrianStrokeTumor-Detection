# Brain Disease Detection System

## Overview
###Brain Stroke
A brain stroke, also known as a cerebrovascular accident (CVA), occurs when blood flow to a part of the brain is interrupted, leading to brain cell damage. Symptoms may include sudden numbness, confusion, difficulty speaking, and severe headache. Timely diagnosis and treatment are critical, as early intervention can significantly improve recovery outcomes.

###Brain Tumor
A brain tumor is an abnormal growth of cells within the brain or surrounding tissues. Tumors can be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) and can arise from brain cells or spread from other parts of the body. Early detection through imaging techniques is vital for effective treatment and management.

This project is a comprehensive and efficient Brain Stroke and Tumor Detection System built using advanced machine learning and medical imaging techniques. It aims to aid medical professionals in the early diagnosis of strokes and brain tumors, potentially improving patient outcomes through timely intervention.

The project utilizes an enhanced Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network to predict the likelihood of brain stroke based on a set of input features. This project has been implemented with CNN which accepts MRI CT Images as input, and thus classifies the brain stroke as **ischemic** or **hemorrhagic**. 
The project also consists of a Brain Tumor Segmentation Model using U-net that is trained to identify either of the four features: 
-**No Tumor**
-**Necrotic / Core**
-**EDEMA**
-**Enhancing**

# Brain Disease Detection System

## Overview
### Brain Stroke
A brain stroke, also known as a cerebrovascular accident (CVA), occurs when blood flow to a part of the brain is interrupted, leading to brain cell damage. Symptoms may include sudden numbness, difficulty speaking, and severe headache. Timely diagnosis and treatment are critical, as early intervention can significantly improve recovery outcomes.

### Brain Tumor
A brain tumor is an abnormal growth of cells within the brain or surrounding tissues. Tumors can be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) and can arise from brain cells or spread from other parts of the body.

This project is a comprehensive and efficient Brain Stroke and Tumor Detection System built using advanced machine learning and medical imaging techniques. It aims to aid medical professionals in the early diagnosis of strokes and brain tumors, potentially improving patient outcomes through timely intervention.

## Key Features
### Brain Stroke Detection 
- **Enhanced MLP Neural Network:** Utilizes a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model to predict the likelihood of a brain stroke based on various input features.
- **Classification of Brain Stroke:** Implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze MRI/CT images and classify brain strokes as either **ischemic** or **hemorrhagic**.
  
### Brain Tumor Detection and Segmentation 
- U-Net Model for Segmentation: Employs a U-Net architecture to segment brain tumors in medical images. This model is specifically trained to identify and classify the following features:
    - **No Tumor:** Indicates the absence of any tumor.
    - **Necrotic/Core:** Represents dead or dying tissue within a tumor, suggesting advanced tumor progression.
    - **Edema:** Detects swelling caused by excess fluid around the tumor, which can indicate the tumor's impact on surrounding brain tissue.
    - **Enhancing:** Identifies areas of the tumor that show abnormal blood vessels and a disrupted blood-brain barrier.

### Web-Based Implementation
- **Frontend Technologies:** Developed using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, providing a user-friendly interface for interaction.
- **Backend Framework:** Utilizes Flask to handle requests and manage the backend logic of the application, including model predictions and image processing.

### Predictive and Diagnostic Capabilities
- **Predictive Analysis:** Provides predictions on stroke likelihood based on user-input features, aiding in early diagnosis.
- **Tumor Feature Identification:** Helps in identifying specific tumor characteristics, which can guide treatment decisions.

### Features of the MLP Dataset
- Gender: This feature may influence stroke risk factors and outcomes.
- Age: Age is a significant risk factor for strokes, with older individuals generally at higher risk.
- Hypertension: Indicates whether the individual has high blood pressure (yes/no). Hypertension is a well-known risk factor for stroke.
- Heart Disease: Indicates the presence of any heart disease (yes/no). Heart conditions can increase the likelihood of a stroke.
- Ever Married: This feature may reflect social support systems that could influence health outcomes.
- Work Type: Categorizes the individualâ€™s type of occupation. Different work types may have varying health risks and stress levels.
- Residence Type: Describes whether the individual lives in an urban or rural area. This may affect access to healthcare and lifestyle factors.
- Avg Glucose Level: The average blood glucose level of the individual, measured in mg/dL. Elevated glucose levels can be a risk factor for both strokes and diabetes.
- BMI (Body Mass Index): BMI is an important indicator of obesity, which is a risk factor for stroke.
- Smoking Status: Indicates the individual's smoking behavior (e.g., never smoked, former smoker, current smoker). Smoking is a significant risk factor for stroke.

### Target Variable of the MLP Dataset
- Yes: Likely to suffer a Brain Stroke (1)
- No: Not likely to suffer a Brain Stroke (0)

### Target Variable of the CNN Dataset
- Hemorrhagic: 
- Ischemic:
